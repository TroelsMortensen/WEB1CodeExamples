        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph <i>with italics</i> and a <br/> line break
        followed by a horizontal <hr/> ruler.
        Even though I make a line break, this is not shown.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only by making a new paragraph. 

            White space is generally ignored. <br/>

            This is a <b>bold tag with bold text</b>
            And here is an image:<br/>
